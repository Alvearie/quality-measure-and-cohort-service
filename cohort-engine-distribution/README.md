# Cohort Engine Distribution

This module is responsible for packaging the project into solutions for an end user.
Two solutions are created from this build.
* The shaded `jar` created by the [cohort-cli](/cohort-cli) module.
* The `war` containing the cohort REST API produced by the [cohort-engine-api-web](/cohort-engine-api-web) module.
