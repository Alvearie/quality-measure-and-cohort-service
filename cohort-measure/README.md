# Cohort Measure

This module contains classes that perform measure evaluations.
In this context, measures consist of one or multiple cohorts used together to produce a meaningful set of results.
The input measures and output measure reports are expected to follow the [Alvearie CDM FHIR format](https://github.com/Alvearie/alvearie-fhir-ig).
There also exist classes built for base FHIR R4, but they provide limited functionality compared to their CDM counterparts.
