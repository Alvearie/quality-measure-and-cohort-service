# Build tools project

The build module is the first module built as part of the overall project reactor build. The purpose is to enable utilities that will be relevant in the build of other projects. It currently serves as the repository for the static code analysis tool PMD's ruleset definition that is shared across all modules in the build. See https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-pmd-plugin/examples/multi-module-config.html for details.
