# Server-Only Mode Using IBM FHIR

Experimental support has been added to the [IBM Open Source FHIR Server](https://github.com/IBM/FHIR) for the [FHIR Clinical Reasoning Module](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/clinicalreasoning-module.html). The functionality is described under the [FHIRClinicalReasoningGuide](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRClinicalReasoningGuide). This mode of operation simplifies setup, allowing the user to configure a single system that both serves data and does clinical quality language query evaluation. It also provides a mode of operation that reduces the data serialization and transfer requirements necessary in a traditional client-server mode of operation.
