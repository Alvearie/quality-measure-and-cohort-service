# Cohort Evaluator

This module is intended to provide functionality for executing generic cohort evaluations.
No assumptions are made on how cohorts are formatted, or where they are stored.
Implementations of key classes may need to be created depending on the usecase.
See [cohort-evaluator-hapi-fhir](/cohort-evaluator-hapi-fhir) for an example implementation.
